"""``simkit`` -- the extra scene machinery this task needs, installed by patching at import time.

A ``yam_arena`` task file may only list ``Box``, upright ``Cylinder``, ``Sphere`` and library ``Asset``
objects, each one rigid body with one primitive collider, one flat sRGB colour and the one shared
friction material. This task needs more than that, so this module adds it **without touching
``yam_arena`` or ``isaaclab_arena``**: both stay at their pinned versions, and everything here ships
inside the task folder and installs itself when the task file is imported.

What it adds
------------
``Part``   a ``Box`` subclass (so ``task_file.load``'s ``isinstance`` check still passes) that also
           carries an MDL material, an opacity, its own friction/restitution, a collision
           approximation, a shape other than a box, and child ``Piece``s welded into one rigid body.
``Piece``  one more bit of geometry under the same rigid body: this is how a hollow or concave tool
           is built, since PhysX wants convex colliders.

How the patches work
--------------------
``use_production_assets()``
    Arena 0.3.x rewrites its object-library root to the ``omniverse-content-staging`` bucket, which no
    longer serves those files -- its own ``assets/nucleus.py`` still carries
    ``TODO(2026.07.14, Point Arena assets to the production bucket before release)``. Every library
    asset, and the stock ``station`` scene with it, therefore fails to load with
    ``Failed to open layer @https://omniverse-content-staging...``. The identical paths are served
    from ``omniverse-content-production``, so the host is rewritten when an asset is looked up.

``patch_scene()``
    ``yam_arena.scene.task_object`` turns one task-file spec into one Arena object. The task file is
    imported before Isaac Sim starts, so ``yam_arena.scene`` (which imports ``isaaclab.sim``) cannot
    be imported yet; instead a ``sys.meta_path`` finder wraps that module's loader and applies the
    patch the moment the embodiment imports it, after Kit is up. The patched ``task_object`` builds
    ``Part`` specs itself and hands everything else to the original.

``patch_demo()``
    ``demo.Waypoint.yaw`` is a float that ``demo.grip_rotation`` turns into a straight-down grip
    rotated about the vertical, which cannot tilt the wrist. ``ArmPlan`` already solves IK for a full
    TCP rotation, so ``grip_rotation`` is wrapped to pass a 3x3 matrix straight through while a float
    still reaches the original. A waypoint may then carry ``rot_y(-0.6) @ DOWN`` to tilt the gripper.
    (NumPy only, so this patch applies immediately.)

Nothing here mutates a pinned module's source; each patch is idempotent and re-entrant-safe.
