"""On the station table: a grey plastic linear rail (290 mm long, T-shaped top) lying loose on the midline, pointing
away from the arms, its open end nearest them, an orange end stop part way along and a plain handle beyond it; and a
blue carriage block (40 x 30 x 17 mm) with a matching T-shaped channel, standing on the table to the right. The robot must slide the carriage onto the
rail's open end and push it along until it clicks past the spring-loaded plunger and sits against the end stop.
