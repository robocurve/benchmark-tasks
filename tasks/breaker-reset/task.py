"""On the station table, in front of the left arm: a grey service panel (160 x 340 x 25 mm, 3 kg) carrying four
breakers side by side, 90 mm apart along y. Each breaker is a white body (60 x 44 x 6 mm) with a red strip across its
+x end (ON) and a green strip across its -x end (OFF), and a black toggle (16 x 20 x 32 mm) that slides along x on the
body, +-14 mm. Sliding it toward the red end switches the breaker on, toward the green end off. Breakers 1, 2 and 4
(y -135, -45 and +135 mm) start ON (toggle at +12 mm). Breaker 3 (y +45 mm) has tripped: its toggle sits midway.

A tripped breaker is trip-free. Pushed straight to the red end it springs back to the middle and stays tripped; it has
to be pushed fully to OFF (past -8 mm) first, and then to ON (past +8 mm) like any other breaker. A good breaker
switches off at -8 mm and on again at +8 mm; each toggle is held by a light spring (60 N/m: it stays where it was
pushed, and a finger brushing it does not flip it).

A grey cover plate (170 x 350 x 4 mm, 250 g) lies over the breakers, 3 mm above the toggles, on two low posts. It slides
along x on a spring (20 N/m) that pulls it shut. A small upright tab on its front edge, on the right half, is for
pushing it open. A toggle can only be reached once the cover is pushed back by about 140 mm, and it slides shut as soon
as it is let go: one arm has to hold it open while the other arm works the breaker.
