"""On the station table, a belt drive with its belts off: a blower fixed in place in front of the right arm, its
90 mm pulley's outer face toward the arms on the line x 23.0 cm, and, 290 mm to its left, a loose motor (a 150 g
bench model with a 64 mm pulley) standing on a fixed steel base plate, turned 3 degrees and with its pulley face
12 mm behind the line. A 480 mm aluminium straightedge stands on its edge on a felt strip in front of them. Lining
up the pulleys as HVAC mechanics do: lay the straightedge across both pulleys' outer faces, flat on the blower's,
and slide and turn the motor on its plate until its pulley's face is in the same plane; then let go of everything.
The score is the total misalignment M (the motor's turn plus its offset over the centre distance, in degrees).

The blower and the motor are mechkit compounds (mechkit.py, next to this file: the blower fixed, the motor one loose
rigid body with its shaft and pulley along its length); the scorer reads the motor's pose from mechkit and the arms
(TCP, pad tips, opening) through rigstate.py, which wraps the embodiment's step and reset from this file's import.
Neither changes what the embodiment does.

Run it:  inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_arena -E task=task.py --scorer task_score -E object_jitter=0 ...
Demo:    inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_arena --policy yam_scripted -E task=task.py -E object_jitter=0 ...
One arm: DEMO_IDLE_ARM=left (or right) before the demo command leaves that arm at its ready pose.
