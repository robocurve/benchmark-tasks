"""On the station table: a 12 cm block, too wide for a gripper to pick up, stands in a rubber-matted lane with low
yellow curbs either side. One of its faces, the next to be machined, is painted red; each neighbouring face has a red band
along the edge it shares with the red face, so the top shows which way the red face lies, and no band means it is
underneath. The robot must tip the block over its edges along the lane until the red face is up, and move both hands away.
A push high on a face tips it; a push low only slides it. Lots A, B and C start with the red face to the left, to the
right and underneath; the environment variable TIP_LOT picks one (A by default).

Run it:  TIP_LOT=A inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_tip -E task=task.py -E object_jitter=0 --policy yam_scripted \\
           --instruction "Tip the block over along the lane, without lifting it, until its red face is on top, then move both hands away." --scorer task_score

`yam_tip` (tip_die_block/embodiment.py) spawns the lane and the marked block, and reports each gripper's fingertip midpoint.
