"""On the station table: an 18650 flashlight (110 mm long, black anodised aluminium) standing head-down on its bezel
midway between the arms, its tail open and its tube empty; beside it, on the right arm's side, its screw-on tail cap
lying open end down and an 18650 lithium-ion cell (18 x 65 mm) lying on its side, positive end pointing away from
the robot. The left arm holds the flashlight body; the right arm puts the cell into the tube positive end first
(toward the LED), then screws the tail cap back on (clockwise seen from above, about one turn).

Scoring: 0.25 for each of ``STEPS`` (battery picked up, battery in positive end first, cap on the thread, cap screwed
down); 0 with the cell in the wrong way round, a part off the table, or the cap forced down without turning. The
grippers' state comes from the simulator (``GripperState``), and the cap's turn on the thread from the parts'
orientations.

The flashlight is three rigid bodies (body, tail cap, battery) from ``assets/``; the cap's 4-start thread collides as
modelled, and the cell has 0.4 mm of radial play in the bore.

Run it:  inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_arena -E task=flashlight_insertion.py --scorer task_score ...

The stock task-file format spawns primitives and Arena library models, upright and gripped straight down. This file
extends it without changing yam_arena: ``UsdPart`` objects are spawned from their own USD files at a full pose with
the physics authored there (``yam_arena.scene.task_object`` is wrapped once that module is imported, after Isaac Sim
starts), and ``Waypoint.rot`` gives the scripted demo full gripper rotations (``yam_arena.demo.ArmPlan.target``).
