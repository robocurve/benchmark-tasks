"""On the station table: a blue laser housing (fixed) 12 cm in front of the left arm, 6 cm inboard of it, whose beam,
always on, runs 40 mm above the table along x, between two thin red lines, into a black beam dump 50 cm out; a yellow
detector (fixed) facing forward 20 cm in front of the right arm's base line, 16 cm right of the midline, with a
black backstop board behind it and two thin black lines either side of its axis; two loose silver mirrors
(20 x 60 x 60 mm, a 40 x 40 mm mirror in the middle of each 60 x 60 face, framed by a 10 mm rim that does not
reflect), one in front of each arm, and a loose orange beam block (40 x 40 x 60 mm) beside the beam.
Steer the beam off both mirrors onto the detector's centre. The scorer traces the beam every control step: it must
never leave the table, and a mirror must never move while the beam is on it, so the block goes into the beam before
the mirrors go in and comes out once both are set.

The scorer reads the arms (TCP, finger tips, gripper opening) through rigstate.py, which wraps the embodiment's
step and reset from this file's import; it changes nothing the embodiment does.

Run it:  inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_arena -E task=task.py --scorer task_score -E object_jitter=0 ...
Demo:    inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_arena --policy yam_scripted -E task=task.py -E object_jitter=0 ...
One arm: DEMO_IDLE_ARM=left (or right) before the demo command leaves that arm at its ready pose.
