"""On the station table: a lot of six machined aluminium blocks lies flat in two rows of three near the arms. They look
alike, but they come in three heights: in tolerance (35.5 mm), 3.5 mm oversize and 3.5 mm undersize, how many of each
depending on the lot, and their lengths and widths vary so that footprint and mass do not tell the kinds apart. A fixed two-limit bridge gauge stands beyond them:
a green GO bar on the left (its underside 37.5 mm above the table) and a red NO-GO bar on the right (34.0 mm). A good
block slides under the GO bar but stops at the NO-GO bar; an oversize one stops at the GO bar; an undersize one slides
under both. The robot must gauge every block and put the good ones in the green ACCEPT tray on the left, the oversize
ones in the red OVERSIZE tray and the undersize ones in the blue UNDERSIZE tray, both on the right. Then it decides the
lot: a yellow lot tag goes on the green RELEASE pad if at most 2 of the 6 are out of tolerance, otherwise on the red
HOLD pad. Three lots (A, B, C) say which block lies where and what it measures; the environment variable GAUGE_LAYOUT
picks one (A by default).

Run it:  GAUGE_LAYOUT=A inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_gauge -E task=tasks/gauge-sorting/task.py \\
           --instruction "Check each block, lying flat, with the two-bar gauge: put blocks that slide under the green GO bar but not under the red NO-GO bar in the green ACCEPT tray, blocks that don't fit under the GO bar in the red OVERSIZE tray, and blocks that also slide under the NO-GO bar in the blue UNDERSIZE tray; then put the yellow lot tag on the green RELEASE pad if at most 2 of the 6 blocks were out of tolerance, otherwise on the red HOLD pad." --scorer task_score ...

`yam_gauge` (gauge_sorting/embodiment.py) is the stock yam_arena embodiment that also reports `left_tcp` and
`right_tcp`, so the scorer can tell whether a block has been let go.
