"""Geometry and mechanism constants of the puller fixture. NumPy only. Metres, kg, radians; quaternions xyzw.

Screw model (declared constitutive coupling): a rotating-nut screw. The handle turns in the puller body on a
revolute joint; the ram slides in the body on a prismatic joint whose stiff drive (physics rate, internal, so
equal and opposite on ram and body) tracks LEAD x the handle's measured turns; the drive's resisting force is
fed back to the handle as torque F*LEAD/(2 pi). PhysX's native rack-and-pinion joint is refused in this
direct-GPU scene (probe-001).
