"""gluekit: compound rigid bodies and sliding bar clamps on a glued panel, for a yam_arena task file.

Written for the glue-up task in this folder, from the helpers of our earlier tasks. Importing it is cheap
(NumPy only): everything that needs Isaac Sim is imported lazily, inside hooks that run once the simulator has
started.

What it adds to a plain task file:

- :class:`Body`: one rigid body (or a fixed fixture, without a mass) made of several boxes and cylinders; a colour
  with a fourth (alpha) component below 1 is drawn see-through (glass).
- :class:`Slider`: a prismatic joint between two bodies (a clamp's sliding jaw on its bar).
- :class:`Clamps`: sliding bar clamps with a ratchet, squeezing a glued pair of boards through pad springs we compute.
- Force models run before every physics substep (240 Hz), so a quick motion cannot skip them.
- :func:`finger_points`: the grippers' collision-hull vertices, for scoring whether a gripper touches a part.
- :func:`on_reset`: functions to run at every episode reset, e.g. to clear latched scoring state.
