# Set a cordless jigsaw's shoe to a 45-degree bevel and lock it

A DeWalt DCS331 20V MAX jigsaw (bare tool: battery out, no blade, 5.4 lb) lies on its left side on a rubber bench
mat, front away from the robot, its shoe square and clamped. The robot sets the shoe to a 45 degree bevel, clamps
it and lets go. The instruction says only that.

GPU results (2026-11-14, L40S): the scripted demo scores 1.0 (see Results in simulation). The first GPU run had scored
it 0.0: a closed-finger push on the lever's tab wedged, so the shoe stayed clamped. The demo now pinches the tab and
swings the lever along its arc instead.

## Why it is hard

1. **The lever unlocks the shoe, but the shoe still does not tilt.** The maker's manual: "pull the keyless bevel
   lever to the side" to unlock, then "slide the shoe forward to release it from the 0 degree positive stop". With
   the lever out and the shoe not slid, a push on its edge meets the stop and the shoe stays square.
2. **Detents on the way.** The shoe tilts through detents at 15 and 30 degrees before 45 (the end of travel). A push
   that stops at the first click leaves a 15 degree bevel.
3. **It is not set until it is clamped.** The lever must be pushed back under the body; an unclamped shoe moves
   under a light push. The score is read with both hands at least 5 cm away for 2 s.
4. **The hands.** Everything is done with straight-down grippers: a pinch on the lever's 6 mm finger tab, which lies
   in a 22 mm gap beside the motor housing, carried along the lever's arc; a grip on the shoe's 10 mm edge where it
   stands clear in front of the gear housing; a sideways push on that edge; the same pinch to swing the lever back.
   Every working point keeps 15 mm or more from body parts it does not work on, except the fingers astride the
   flush tab, 7 mm from the housing (all the gap allows).

## Scoring

Conditions (real trial in brackets):

- Bevel: the shoe's angle to square, either way (protractor between shoe and body side).
- Clamped: the lever within 10 degrees of flush under the body (then a 5 N push on the shoe's top edge, spring
  scale, turns it under 1 degree; unclamped it moves 10 degrees or more).
- Hands off: on every step of the last 2 s every part of both grippers' fingers 5 cm or more from the saw (video).
- Still: over the last 2 s the bevel changes 0.5 degree or less, the lever 2 degrees or less, the body 2 mm or less.
- Unlocked off the stop: at some point the lever out (10 degrees or more) while the shoe is 6 mm or more forward of
  its 0 degree stop (a pencil mark on the shoe against the gear housing, video).
- Latched zero: the saw pushed 30 mm or more from its tape marks, turned 15 degrees or more up off its side, or
  dropped.

| Outcome | Score |
|---|---|
| Hands off, still, bevel 45 +-2 degrees, clamped | 1.0 |
| Hands off, still, bevel 45 +-2 degrees, not clamped | 0.75 |
| Hands off, still, bevel 28 degrees or more (the 30 detent or past it), not 45 | 0.5 |
| Unlocked off the stop at some point, none of the above (held, at 15, touched) | 0.25 |
| Anything else, or after a latched zero | 0 |

Success: 1.0 held for 1 s. Doing nothing scores 0.

## Offline predictions (no physics)

| Run | What it does | Predicted |
|---|---|---|
| `DEMO_HOLD_ONLY=1` | both arms hold still | 0.0 |
| Scripted demo | both arms, below | 1.0 (held from step 1,055 of 1,200) |
| `DEMO_IDLE_ARM=left` | the right hand alone | 1.0 offline (see below) |
| `DEMO_IDLE_ARM=right` | the left hand only rests on the handle | 0.0 |
| `DEMO_VARIANT=no_unlock` | lever never swung out: pull and push meet a clamped shoe | 0.0 |
| `DEMO_VARIANT=no_slide` | lever out, no slide: the push meets the 0 degree stop; lever back | 0.0 |
| `DEMO_VARIANT=stop_at_15` | the push stops in the 15 degree detent; lever back | 0.25 |
| `DEMO_VARIANT=lever_left_out` | shoe at 45, lever left out | 0.75 |

One arm: the right hand makes every move; the left only steadies the saw on its handle while the right pulls and
pushes along and across it. On the GPU the right hand alone also scored 1.0 (the 2.45 kg saw on rubber did not
skid). The task does not claim that two arms are needed.

## Demo

Open loop, timed waypoints from the known layout; both grippers straight down, fingers closing along y (wrist yaw
0). A closed gripper (1 mm commanded) acts as one block 20 mm along x and 17 mm along y. Five deliberate moves:

- Right, 0 to 11.25 s, move 1: open 20 mm, down astride the lever's finger tab (pad tips level with the housing's
  top, 7 mm from the tab and from the housing either side), pinches the tab (2 mm commanded) and carries it up
  along its arc to 50 degrees in five 10 degree legs (the fingers close along the lever's hinge axis, so the tab
  turns between the pads); lets go: past 25 degrees the lever goes on out to 60; up.
- Left, 11.25 to 15.25 s, move 2: from home, rests its closed fingers on the top handle's upper side, 1.5 mm in,
  and stays there until 33.25 s (while the right pulls and pushes along and across the saw), then goes home.
- Right, 11.25 to 22.75 s, move 3: open 60 mm, down astride the shoe's edge 40 mm ahead of the gear housing, closes
  on the 10 mm edge (2 mm commanded), pulls 12 mm forward (the shoe stops at the slot's end, 10 mm; 6 mm takes it
  off the stop), lets go, up.
- Right, 22.75 to 33.25 s, move 4: closed, down on the housing side of the shoe's upper rib, pushes 34.5 mm
  outward: the shoe tilts past 15 and 30 to 45 (the end of travel), the block 3.3 mm past the 45 degree contact;
  backs off, up. It then waits over the shoe until the left is home (36.75 s).
- Right, 36.75 to 48.5 s, move 5: back along the saw above the open lever, open 20 mm down astride its tab at 60
  degrees, pinches the same spot and carries it back down its arc to 5 degrees: under 10 the shoe clamps at 45;
  lets go (under 25 the lever falls flush); up, home at 51 s.

Success is held from about 52.75 s (2 s hands off and still, then 1 s). Smallest clearance offline: the open
fingers astride the flush tab 7 mm from the housing (15 mm or more once the lever is 15 degrees out), the pad
block to the body 16.3 mm while astride the shoe's edge; arm capsules 2.7 cm; grippers 20.8 cm apart.

Why not a push: the first GPU run pushed the tab's rear face forward with closed fingers. That face is 7 to 22.5 mm
above the pivot and 57 mm behind it, so the push turns the lever only while the pad friction is under 0.4; above
that it wedges. On the GPU the arm stalled 21 mm short and the lever turned 1 degree.

inspect-robots run --embodiment yam_arena --policy yam_scripted -E task=task.py -E object_jitter=0 \

```

`TASK_TRACE=trace.jsonl` writes one line per control step: the three joints, the rule's mode and targets, the
tier's inputs, the body's offset from its marks and tilt, the shoe's top front corner, the lever tab's top and both
TCPs in the saw's frame, the gripper openings, and where the pinched spot of the tab and the gripped spot of the
shoe's edge are from the right pad tips (about (0, 0, 5) and (0, 0, 4) while held; a growing offset is a slip).

## Simplifications

- **One software rule** (`shoerule.py`) stands for the stop, the detents and the clamp: it writes drive targets on
  the three joints every control step. Clamped (lever under 10 degrees): the slide and bevel are held where they
  were (10,000 N/m and 20 N m/rad: 5 N on the edge turns the shoe 0.6 degree). Unclamped: the slide follows the
  hand (its target led by 0.9 of its last step's travel, as in our GPU-tested pliers task); the bevel is held at 0
  until the shoe is 6 mm forward, then follows the same way with a detent pull of at most 0.03 N m within 3
  degrees of 0, 15, 30 and 45 either way. The lever is an over-centre cam: under 25 degrees it falls flush, above
  it rests at 60, each pull at most 0.05 N m.
- Rigid boxes. The shoe, its carriage and the lever are links of one articulation and do not collide with the body;
  their shapes are laid out so they do not overlap it in the demo's range.
- The real DCS331's lever swings to one side; which side is not in the manual. The layout assumes the saw's right
  (up, as it lies on its left side). If it swings to the left on the real saw, the real trial lays the saw on its
  right side and mirrors the layout.

Estimates (not measured on a saw): the shoe's size (170 x 90 mm, 4 mm plate, 6 mm ribs) and mass (250 g), the lever's
size, place, travel and tab, the 6 mm slide off the stop and the 10 mm slot, the gap between shoe and housing, the
handle's shape, every force of the rule. The real trial measures them on the saw first.

## Real build and reset

The saw, battery out and no blade; a rubber mat taped down with marks for the saw's outline; a protractor, a ruler,
a 10 N spring scale, top and side video. Reset: pull the lever out, tilt the shoe back to 0, slide it back into the
0 degree stop, push the lever back under the body and check the shoe will not tilt; lay the saw on its marks.
